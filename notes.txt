Patrick's To-do:
1. Make basic Flask project on azure server
2. Change flask to run on one of the open ports, or just open port 5000
  a. If I use port 5000 then close both 80 and 443
3. Set up server in VSCode so I can edit code right from there
4. Get google maps api working on the server
5. Do data processing with the response and calculate time saved, gas saved, CO2 emissions, etc.
6. maybe just do all development locally and then push it to github and then push github to azure
